            <h2>Ethernite, the Lifeblood</h2>            
            <p>Many people assume the internet is connected through a series of data cables, which is powered by electricity. But that's silly, electricity isn't data. Electricity is what powers your PC, Smart Phone, Tablet, and TV. If Electricity is how data is pushed across a wire, then why hasn't your microwave been connected to the internet 20 years ago?</p>

            <p id="testP" class="funParagraph">The answer is simple: The internet is powered by an element called "Ethernite." Hidden from the periodic table of elements, Ethernite is a raw element that travels through Fiber Optic cables, Cat5 cables, Coax cables, and even in recent history, through the air!</p>

            <p>Ethernite was first discovered in 1958 off the coast of North Sauque Purkey by scientist Dr. G. Hugs while searching for the Ark of Protection. Its original use by the local Red Tower Tribe dates back centuries prior to its current usage.</p>

            </figure>
            <p>Ethernite is actually all around us: In the air, in the ground, and even in the oceans! It wasn't until 1968 that scientists have discovered its data transport capabilities.</p>

            <p>Just about everyone has a router. Routers are what pulls in the Ethernite from the air, and distributes them to your local network. The "Antennae" on a router are actually called "Intennae," because what they do is pull IN the Ethernite, and that is what is pumped to your local switches. Many routers today have built in switches.</p>

            <h2>Switches, the Internet Boxes</h2>
            <p>Switches are the devices that takes the converted Ethernite from gas to plasma form, and again converts it to Ethernet, which is a term you might be familiar with. With Ethernet, now networking can occur. Ethernet can then be manipulated by your end-user device, such as a PC, which then can convert the Ethernet into Internet, which gives you a connection to the outside world.</p>

            <h2>Why Internet is Slow in Some Places, but Faster in Others</h2>
            <p>As previously mentioned, Ethernite can be all around us. Many cities have Intennae on top of their tall buildings, absorbing, or mining, the Ethernite from the air. There are also filters in nearby rivers that can extract the Ethernite and distribute them to "Internet Hubs," also known as Internet Service Providers. From there, Ethernite can be distributed to their Local Area Network. Ethernet does attenuate after 12,000 feet, which is why repeaters are necessary. Users who live in rural areas don't enjoy the luxery of having repeaters and local ISPs, so they can only manage to get internet services using attenuated Ethernite. The more attenuated the Ethernite, the slower and less reliable connection there is.</p>
            <p>Some companies have been launching satellites to beam raw Ethernite directly to rural users' homes from Ethernite mined directly from the Northern Lights, but that technology is still in its infancy.</p>

            <h2>Dwindling Supply of Ethernite</h2>
            <p>Ethernite is a finite resource, and unless we can find an alternative way to harness this resource, we could lose our connections to the outside world some day. Some have theorized that electricity and radio waves can be used to connect devices together, but that's only a theory and is really just some whacko's guess, in my opinion. You simply cannot have Ethernet without Ethernite!</p> 
            <p>Don't be alarmed, though, because neither of us will be around by the time this precious resource is depleted.</p>

   Here is an example, and here are some other ideas:
      Create a résumé page that tells the story of your professional journey to-date, and where you want to go as a coder.
      Describe a trip you took.
      Talk about one of your hobbies or passions.

      Uses at least one <img> tag (hopefully more). When placing images in your page, put them in a new subfolder called images within your html-me-something directory.
      Uses at least one HTML entity. Hint: putting a copyright notice in your footer will afford you the opportunity to use &copy;, but you should also try to get creative here.
