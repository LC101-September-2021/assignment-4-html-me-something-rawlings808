<!-- Tells a story. This can be personal or impersonal, funny, serious or neither. 
   You can do whatever you like, but it should be something in the range of 3-10 paragraphs or sections. 

   Here is an example, and here are some other ideas:
      Create a résumé page that tells the story of your professional journey to-date, and where you want to go as a coder.
      Describe a trip you took.
      Talk about one of your hobbies or passions.

   Does each of the following:
      Uses each of the following structural HTML5 tags: <p>, <header>, <footer>, <main>, <article>. If you need to review any of these tags, check out the HTML tag reference at w3schools.
      Uses at least one <img> tag (hopefully more). When placing images in your page, put them in a new subfolder called images within your html-me-something directory.
      Uses at least one HTML entity. Hint: putting a copyright notice in your footer will afford you the opportunity to use &copy;, but you should also try to get creative here.
      Demonstrates creativity. Don’t stop with these items or tags. 
         Have some ideas for your page, and make it great. And dig into the w3schools HTML reference to learn more about other tags, their usage and attributes! -->
